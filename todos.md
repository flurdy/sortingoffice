On the dashboard the quick actions needs updating, the domain and backup can merge, some resources are missing etc.

Update the statistics page with more metrics.

Go over the Rust code to see if there is any duplication we can make cleaner.

when filling in an alias destination we could have an inline search for an existing alias, whilst still support adding unknown destinations.

create a few functional testing journeys

please add support for multiple databases as this will manage several servers

Lets discuss how we can support different databases with different field names.

Add feature toggles, per database, for read only, for no new users, for no new domains. For no password updates.

Add Dutch translation

Add German translation

Should we still use a CDN for HTMX and Tailwind?

Put inline css style and scripts in the header into separate files where suitable

The dashboard stats should be changed to
  - a combined enabled domains and backups total
  - an enabled aliases total
  - an enabled users total

The dashboard should have descriptive link to further stats and reports

The current dashboard quick actions are a bit repetitive, perhaps invert it.

// Rules for Cursor to follow

To unit test use `make test-unit`.

Check compilation often with `cargo check`.

If intending to use `cargo run`, check if already running, or `cargo watch -x run`, or if `make run` is running, if `cargo run` is running `pkill` it 

Please format code frequently.

Please add and update unit tests when applicable.

Please always check compilation if any Rust code is changed.

If any documentation is needed put in /docs, or in README.md if important.

The database is in docker compose, if needed this can be stopped and recreated.

Use the makefiles aliases when appropriate

Update the todo file with tick when finished a task.

Before starting a new todo ask for confirmation.

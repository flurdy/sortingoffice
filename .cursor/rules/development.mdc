Please always check compilation with `cargo check` if any Rust code is changed.

The last step is alwys to run `cargo check --test` to make sure everything is ok.

Please format code frequently.
- run `cargo fmt --all -- --check` before any task is finished

Please add and update unit tests when applicable.

Use the makefiles aliases when appropriate

If any documentation is needed put in /docs, or in README.md if important.

Use curl to verify UI changes

make sure there are no compilation warnings before finishing a task

Delete any unused variables and imports

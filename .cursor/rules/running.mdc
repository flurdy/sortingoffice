If intending to use `cargo run`, check if already running, or `cargo watch -x run`, or if `make run` is running, if `cargo run` is running `pkill` it 

To pkill remember that we use fish shell so need to specify process name.

if `cargo watch`  or `make run` is running it should restart itself.

Before a `cargo run` always chech with `cargo check` first.

To restart `cargo run` use  `pkill -f sortingoffice; sleep 1; cargo run & sleep 3`

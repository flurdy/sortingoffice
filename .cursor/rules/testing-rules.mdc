Do not use `cargo test` on its own to run all the unit tests as that also includes UI selenium tests which often fail.

Do use `cargo test` if testing a specific test.

Do not use `cargo test -lib` as this project does not have a library target.

To run all unit test use `make test-unit`.

For UI test use `make test-ui`.

Try to include timeouts so tests do not hang forever.

Most of the integration and UI tests use testcontainers for selenium and databases.
